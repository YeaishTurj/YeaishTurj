# Hey 👋, this is your go-to tech friend, ```Yeaish Jahan Turj```! 👨‍💻

Welcome to my profile! I'm a Computer Science student, future software engineer, and an all-around tech enthusiast. If you're into coding, competitive programming, or just need a good laugh while debugging, you’re in the right place! 🚀

# 💫 About Me:  
#### 🔭 I’m currently working on  
I’m currently wrestling with JavaFX to build a desktop app for my academic project. It’s basically a chaotic love triangle between me, the compiler, and the database—where the database keeps ghosting me, but I’m determined to win its heart. Spoiler alert: it's a drama-filled journey with occasional happy endings! 😂  

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning  
How to write code that *doesn’t* double as a bug factory—that’s the dream! Between wrestling with competitive programming and dabbling in web development, I’m also collecting shiny new skills to make my GitHub look less like a war zone and more like a tech playground. By graduation, my **Tech Stack** might just need its own zip code! 😅

#### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
Anything cool and challenging—as long as it doesn’t involve debugging infinite loops at 3 AM (been there, cried about it). But hey, if your project comes with a good laugh and some snacks, count me in! 😅  

#### 🤝 I’m looking for help with  
Figuring out why my code behaves like a genius at midnight but turns into a drama queen during demos. And if you’re fluent in Arch Linux, please rescue me from its endless maze—I’ll trade you eternal gratitude, unlimited virtual coffee, and maybe even name my next bug after you! ☕😂

#### 💬 Ask me about  
My uncanny ability to break perfectly fine code just by staring at it too hard—it’s basically my superpower. 🦸‍♂️ When I’m not busy breaking my own code, I’m the “tech wizard” everyone calls. Need Windows installed? Updates fixed? Laptop refusing to cooperate? My friends and family call me faster than you can say, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” Half my life is spent clicking “Next” on installers and pretending to know what I’m doing—spoiler: it works 90% of the time! 😂

#### ⚡ Fun fact  
I use Arch Linux because every other OS turns my laptop into a frying pan—seriously, I could probably cook an egg on it (okay, maybe that's too much). With Arch, my laptop stays chill, and I get to flex my terminal ninja skills (even if half the time, I’m just Googling what to type). It’s a love-hate relationship, but hey, it keeps life interesting! 😂
