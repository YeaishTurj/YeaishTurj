# 💫 About Me:
#### 🔭 I’m currently working on  
I’m currently building a desktop application using JavaFX for my academic project—because who wouldn’t want to combine the elegance of Java with the power of a graphical interface? 🤓 It’s basically a dance between the compiler and the database, where I try to make them play nice together (spoiler: sometimes they don’t!). But hey, the challenge is half the fun, right? 😅 Who knows, maybe next time you come by, you’ll see a whole new project (or a new set of bugs to laugh at 😂)

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning  
###### How to write code that doesn’t come with “surprise features” (also known as bugs) 😅 (trust me, no kidding!).
When I'm not battling through a jungle of data structures and algorithms (competitive programming life 🧠💥), I’m sneaking some time into web development (spoiler: yeah, it’s for my academic purposes, but don’t tell anyone) 🌐. When I'm not buried in code challenges, I’m on a mission to learn some shiny new skills to make my GitHub look even more awesome 🛠️. By the time I graduate, you might catch me dabbling in Android development 📱, machine learning 🤖, or maybe even conquering the cloud and AI ☁️—because hey, who doesn’t love a toolbox that's ready for anything? 🚀

#### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
Anything that doesn’t involve debugging infinite loops at 3 AM (but hey, I’m still up for a challenge!).  

#### 🤝 I’m looking for help with
Figuring out why my code works perfectly at midnight but not during the demo 😅.
Also, if you happen to be an Arch Linux wizard, please send help 🙏—because apparently, Arch doesn't have all the software that other OSes have (and I'm starting to believe my laptop's trying to sabotage me). Need assistance getting out of that situation! If anyone can make all software Arch-compatible, I’ll owe you a lifetime supply of virtual coffee ☕💻.


#### 💬 Ask me about
How I manage to break perfectly working code just by “fixing” it 😅.
Also, if you ever find yourself in the dire need of installing some software on your Windows (or anything that involves clicking 'Next' a million times), call me! I’m like the unofficial tech support for my friends and family. Seriously, if there’s a “Windows Install Wizard,” I’m basically its apprentice 👨‍💻✨. I’ve got you covered—just don’t blame me if your computer ends up with too many updates!

#### ⚡ Fun fact  
You might catch me googling or YouTubing about Arch Linux more than I’d like to admit 😅. Not because I’ve fallen head over heels for learning Arch (trust me, it’s not a love story 💔), but because, well, some things on Arch just seem like a mystery box to me 🎁. It’s like solving a puzzle where the pieces don’t quite fit... but hey, that's what makes it fun, right? 🧩 So if you see me staring at my screen with a confused look 🤔, it's probably just me trying to convince Arch to work the way I want it to! 😂

#### 🤖 My Linux Adventures  
##### ⚙️ Why I Use Arch Linux (btw)
I have a very “peculiar” reason for choosing Arch Linux—it’s the coolest (literally) Linux distro for me! On any other Linux system, my HDD starts heating up like it’s auditioning to be a hot plate. And no, I don’t eat hot dogs, nor do I enjoy the idea of having a hot laptop doubling as a space heater. Arch keeps things chill—my laptop stays cool, and I get to flex my terminal kung fu!
